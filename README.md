## Motivation
Developers rarely take their eyes from the terminal, completely disregarding what's it like outside. 

With this cli I can now **easily** and quickly check how it is currently.

## Installation

> Note: you can also use `npx`! See example section.

To intall the cli run:

```bash
$ yarn global add @varandas/sunrise

OR with NPM

$ npm install -g @varandas/sunrise
```

And that's it, you're now empowered!

## Usage

In order to check how it is outside, please just use the following command:

```bash
$ sunrise
```

The cli also accepts a few arguments:

- `--help` - get help on the cli usage.
- `--lat` - specifies location latitude.
- `--long` - specifies location longitude.
- `--extended` - adds more details to the response.
- `--ip` - specifies the ip to use for the location.


### Example 

Get sunrise/sunset details for New York

If you're using npx as an alternative, you can replace `$ sunrise` with `$ npx @varandas/sunrise-cli`
before passing in the arguments.

```bash
$ npx @varandas/sunrise-cli --lat 40.730610 --long -73.935242
```

With global install

```bash
$ sunrise --lat 40.730610 --long -73.935242
```
